# ISLR-Repo

This repository is intended to organize my work as I read through Introduction
to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by G. James et al. The book
website is located at [](www.statlearning.com). All my work is based off
whatever I learn from the book, so really the credit goes to the book authors.
Please don't sue me.
